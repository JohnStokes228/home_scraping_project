"""
Uncle Johnnos' Scraping Project.
Inspired by the other one, though hopefully with some improvements to the design as and when i get to them.
I've decided to keep this file as clean as possible for legibility reasons / because most of what belongs in it is
generic code i also want to use elsewhere. This decision also allows us to delay the activation of the reactor until
such a time as it is unavoidable, thus dodging any nuisance that that usually causes.
