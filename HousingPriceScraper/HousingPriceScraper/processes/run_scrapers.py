file containing code to run spiders, called from main.py if run_scrape is selected.

TODO - incorporate the menus to allow user to manually reduce the list of spiders - in progress, see menus.py
     - add menu to allow user to specify configuration of input urls
     - **add menu to allow user to pick which spiders are visible in the run_scrapers menu**
     - write multiprocessing implementation - crochet/pathos worked before but is there a more elegant solution?
     - !!import spider settings for use in crawler process!! <- legit this one is probs a major deal rn :O
