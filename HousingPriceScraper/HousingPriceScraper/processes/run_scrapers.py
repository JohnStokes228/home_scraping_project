file containing code to run spiders, called from main.py if run_scrape is selected.

TODO - write method to get list of spiders: basically done, though there'll need to be some further work here to filter
       it all down once we know the extent of what isn't a spider in this project
     - incorporate the menus to allow user to manually reduce the list of spiders.
     - add menu to allow user to specify configuration of input urls
     - allow shelf, item and combination spiders to be run using some form of intuitive menu
     - write multiprocessing implementation - crochet/pathos worked before but is there a more elegant solution?
     - !!import spider settings for use in crawler process!!
