"""
ancestor spider is the highest generation of spider involved. will contain all base methods needing to be inherited by
all the descendant spiders.
the spiders exoskeleton wraps the set of gooey interior functions into a single class

TODO - build parse method such that it allows tactility in number of sub functions scrapers iterate through
     - build start requests method such that it is easy to call with minimal effort
     - most likely need to study the existing builds here online
     - have a set of custom settings all spiders have by default
     - consider building a second ancestor for 'item level' scrapes. a nana to every grandpa
