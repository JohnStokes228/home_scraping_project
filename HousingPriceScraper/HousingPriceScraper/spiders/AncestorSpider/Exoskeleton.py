ancestor spider is the highest generation of spider involved. will contain all base methods needing to be inherited by
all the descendant spiders.
the spiders exoskeleton wraps the set of gooey interior functions into a single class

TODO - rewrite start_requests so it can know which function to send requests too based on some attribute
     - **have a set of custom settings all spiders have by default**
     - consider building a second ancestor for 'item level' scrapes. a nana to every grandpa
