file containing Dummy Quotes spider. I will test all future changes on this spider. includes immutable scrape,
addition of expanded list variables.

TODO - write some kind of attribute method to test how multiple drivers works as I think its possible
       that there might be some messiness involved with that. it could just use the one parents driver
       but it needs to be tested to be sure.
