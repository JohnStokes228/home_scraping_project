# home_scraping_project
home made web scraping project intended to allow for robust and scalable scraping of local housing market websites. 

current progress tracked at:
https://johnno.atlassian.net/jira/software/projects/WSH/boards/1

currently at v1, with next general targets being:
  - csv consolidator needs a more robust rewrite, though I'd like to get some actual data in first to better inform how this rewrite might look
  - some live spiders should be written in order to test the system in a more real way.
  - some kind of blog post or something should be written to explain the system to newbies / be slapped onto my linkedin profile in order to flex on the masses
